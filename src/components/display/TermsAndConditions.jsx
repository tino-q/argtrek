      <h4>GENERAL CLAUSES</h4>
      Unless otherwise agreed in writing, making a reservation with the PROVIDER
      shall imply acceptance by the TRAVELER of these legal conditions. No
      stipulation made by the TRAVELER may differ from those of the PROVIDER
      unless expressly accepted in writing and in advance by the PROVIDER. The
      PROVIDER will not be responsible for booking errors attributable to the
      TRAVELER (including but not limited to errors in personal data provided
      for tickets or reservations) or for problems arising from unavoidable and
      extraordinary circumstances beyond its control (strikes, government
      decisions, war, natural disasters, epidemics, etc.). The PROVIDER shall
      provide the TRAVELER, prior to formalizing the contract, with all
      essential information regarding the package travel. The TRAVELER declares
      having received this information through the technical sheet of the trip.

      schedule changes, or other contingencies). The PROVIDER assumes no

      services (excursions, transfers, activities) may be subject to a minimum
      number of participants required by the supplier. If this minimum is not

      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>CANCELLATIONS</h4>
      In accordance with Articles 97.1.l) and 103.l) of Royal Legislative Decree
      1/2007, the 14-day withdrawal right does not apply to package travel
      contracts involving services with specific dates or periods of
      performance. All cancellations must be communicated to the PROVIDER by
      email at sonsolesstays@gmail.com, indicating the reservation number or
      name. Services included in the package travel are contracted with
      suppliers under strictly non-refundable terms, and therefore the
      cancellation penalty shall be: If the reservation is canceled more than 35
      days before the arrival date, the PROVIDER will retain 85% of the total
      package price, refunding the remaining 15%, minus any applicable
      management fees. If the reservation is canceled within 35 days prior to
      arrival, the PROVIDER will retain 95% of the total package price,
      refunding the remaining 5%, minus any applicable management fees. If any
      supplier applies more flexible policies and issues a total or partial
      refund, the PROVIDER will pass this on to the TRAVELER, deducting
      management costs. If any contracted services involve special economic
      conditions (such as charters, ships, special fares, etc.), cancellation
      costs will follow the conditions agreed with those suppliers. The TRAVELER
      may transfer their reservation to another person provided the PROVIDER
      confirms it. The transferee must meet the same conditions as the original
      traveler, and both will be jointly liable to the PROVIDER for payment of
      the price and any additional transfer costs. If the PROVIDER conditions
      the viability of the package to a minimum number of participants and this
      number is not reached, the PROVIDER may cancel the trip with a minimum of
      20 days’ prior notice, granting the TRAVELER a full refund of the amounts
      paid, without the right to claim additional compensation. Failure by the
      TRAVELER to appear at the place, date, and time of commencement of the
      trip (“no show”) will result in the obligation to pay 100% of the total
      price of the trip, without any right to a refund, unless supplier
      conditions establish otherwise. Refunds due as a result of cancellation by
      either the TRAVELER (where legally applicable) or the PROVIDER (including
      failure to reach the minimum number of participants) shall be made without
      undue delay and, in any case, within 14 calendar days from the effective
      termination of the contract. The package requires a minimum of 52
      participants. If this number is not reached, the PROVIDER may cancel the
      trip, notifying the TRAVELER no later than: 20 days before departure for
      trips lasting more than 6 days, 7 days before departure for trips lasting
      2 to 6 days, 48 hours before departure for trips lasting less than 2 days.
      In such cases, the TRAVELER shall be entitled to a full refund of all
      amounts paid, without any additional compensation.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>MODIFICATIONS</h4>
      The PROVIDER may make non-significant changes to the contract, which will
      be communicated clearly and understandably to the TRAVELER. In the event
      of significant modifications to essential elements of the package, or a
      price increase of more than 8%, the TRAVELER may: Accept the proposed
      change, Accept a substitute trip of equal or greater quality (if offered),
      or terminate the contract without penalty. Any refund due must be made
      without undue delay and, in any case, within 14 calendar days from
      termination of the contract. The package price may only be increased in
      the event of variations in: (i) transport costs, including the cost of
      fuel; (ii) taxes or fees imposed by third parties not directly involved in
      the performance of the package, such as tourist taxes, landing taxes or
      embarkation/disembarkation fees; or (iii) exchange rates relevant to the
      package. In such cases, the TRAVELER shall also be entitled to a price
      reduction if those same costs decrease. Any increase shall be notified to
      the TRAVELER no later than 20 days before the start of the trip. No price
      changes may be applied within the 20 days prior to departure.

      compensation. The TRAVELER must inform the PROVIDER before the contract is
      finalized of any reduced mobility, disability, or special need that may
      require adaptations during the trip. The PROVIDER will not assume any

      communicated prior to booking. Any claim by the TRAVELER will be addressed
